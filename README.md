========

allow Node.js to interact with CoreMIDI services on Mac OS platforms

Usage
-----

`coremidi` exports a function which returns a stream. MIDI messages are sent by
writing an array to the stream.

### Simple example

Playing middle C:

```javascript
var coremidi = require('coremidi')();

coremidi.write([144, 60, 127]);
setTimeout(function() {
  coremidi.write([128, 60, 0]);
}, 2000);
```

### Example with [midi-api](https://github.com/carlos8f/node-midi-api)

```javascript
var coremidi = require('coremidi')
  , midi = require('midi-api')()

midi
  .bank(2)
  .program(4)
  .rest(500)

function maj7 (root) {
  midi
    .noteOn(root)
    .noteOn(root + 4)
    .noteOn(root + 7)
    .noteOn(root + 11)
    .rest(1000)
    .noteOff()
}

maj7(60)
maj7(61)
maj7(62)
maj7(63)

midi.pipe(coremidi());
```
